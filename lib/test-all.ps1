# Top-level smoke-test runner for the stride-gemini-exploratory-testing extension.
# PowerShell mirror of test-all.sh.
#
# Runs the structure check and the frontmatter check in sequence and exits
# non-zero if either fails. Offline and read-only — suitable for gating a
# release.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File lib\test-all.ps1
#   (or from Windows PowerShell 5.1:  powershell -File lib\test-all.ps1)
#
# Exit code: 0 only if BOTH checks pass; 1 if either fails.
